## Design of Everyday Things - Ch5: Human Error? No, Bad Design (Jan 16)

**Core Thesis**: Accidents = bad design, not human failure. Use "Five Whys" for root cause [user summary].

**Error Types**:
- **Slips**: Correct goal, wrong execution (action-based, memory-lapse)
- **Mistakes**: Wrong goal/plan (rule-based, knowledge-based, memory-lapse)

**Swiss Cheese Model**: Accidents when defense layer "holes" align perfectly.

**Design Fixes**:
- Forcing functions (interlocks/lockouts)
- Sensibility checks 
- Undo commands
- Visible system state + immediate feedback

✅ Ch5 mastered. Slips/mistakes framework locked.
