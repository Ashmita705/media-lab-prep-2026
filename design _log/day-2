# Day 2: The Design of Everyday Things - Ch2 Psychology (Jan 4, 2026)

## Key Concepts
- **Gulf of Execution**: Figuring out *how* to use something
- **Gulf of Evaluation**: Understanding *what happened* after action
- **3 Levels of Processing**: 
  - Visceral (appearance) → Behavioral (skills) → Reflective (conscious thought)

## 7 Fundamental Design Principles
1. Discoverability - Can tell what actions are possible
2. Feedback - Clear results of actions
3. Conceptual model - System makes sense
4. Affordances - Actions physically possible
5. **Signifiers** - *How* to perform actions
6. Mappings - Natural control relationships
7. Constraints - Guide proper usage

**Key Insight**: Poor design = "learned helplessness" (users blame themselves)
